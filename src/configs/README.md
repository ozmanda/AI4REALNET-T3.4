# Configurations
To run trainings, configurations are required for the ``Learner``, the ``Controller`` and the ``Environment``, all contained within a ``.yaml`` file. These parameter dictionaries are passed to the chosen ``Learner`` class, ``ControllerConfig`` and ``EnvConfig``, respectively. For the environment configuration, either parameters for random environment generation or a specified scenario from ``src/environments`` can be provided. In any case, the parameters for the ``observation_builder`` must be provided. The naming convention for config files is ``algorithm_controllertype`` and to append ``_Scenario`` if it is a scenario-based training run.
