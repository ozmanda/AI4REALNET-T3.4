# Main Code

This codebase is built modularly: 
- **algorithms:** algorithm implementations and configurations, Learner class can be called for training. 
- **evaluation:** scripts and functions to support evaluation
- **networks:** network modules accessed by the algorithms
- **training:** main training scripts 
- **utils:** utility functions
